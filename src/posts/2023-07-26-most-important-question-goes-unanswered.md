For years I’ve been obsessed with statistical mysteries I found in the real world. The mystery is of statistical nature, hence academic, but most cases of mysteries appear in the real world , non academic papers, in newspapers and blog posts. Why ?

Now I think I know why:
Statistics and in particular causality is concerned with forward causal questions , whereas I am interested in reverse.
That’s because statistics is a science and it focus on rigorous problem, and specifically to problems that it can decidedly answer. My interest is exactly on the opposite, the questions that science cannot answer.

This clearly has wittgensteinian roots (surprise!)

This is also connected to the way we live our lives , and another reason why academia is kinda useless for real life. It’s summed up in the quote “I know that only half of my advertisement works, I just don’t know which half”.
To explain, in this relal life case you need to sell, and the real question is which half works. Unless science can help with that it’s of no use in this case.
