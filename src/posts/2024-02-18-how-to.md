First the tokenizer

Our sentence is 
```python
s = "Hello my name is Andre"
```

This will become 
```
[CLS] hello my name is andre [SEP]
```

and that will be come 
```
[CLS],hello,i,',d,like,to,introduce,myself,,,my,name,is,hugging,##face,[SEP]
```

Then let's consider the initial embeddings

why does this work
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
outputs = model(**inputs)
```


and this does not ?
```python
model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```
